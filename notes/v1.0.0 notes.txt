-Though this pedal was designed to fit in a 1590B pedal box, I forgot
to account for the space that the potentiometers require and thus
there isn't enough room in the pedal.

-A buck converter was used to regulate the 9V supply to 5V. It may be
worth it to investigate in using a LDO instead if the project were to
be redone.

-Using an entire dev board for this pedal wasn't a good idea as it
consumes a large area of the PCB. Upon some research into small, 
cheap MCUs that would be compatilbe with my existing code, the ESP32
C3 could be a chip worth taking a look into. 

-A future version of this project could use SMD components to further
reduce the footprint of the design.

-The 0.25" audio jacks that were used took up alot of PCB space so 
using smaller jacks that aren't necessarily meant to be mounted on 
the PCB could be beneficial.

-Having a dedicated connector for the screen would be nice. There is
a ribbon cable connector on the back of the ST7735 module that could
be worth looking into.

-Making the pedal more tolerant to a range of power supplies (say 9V
to 15V) would be a nice feature. This could make using a LDO for
supplying power more difficult or not feasable.

-The device (as is) has enough computing capacity to handle
displaying higher resolution waveforms. The current version is only
displaying 7 bits of precision (due to low resolution of the ST7735
of 128x128) out of the 12 bits that the ADC of the ESP32 is reading.
Not to mention that we collect 512 ADC readings and are only 
displaying 128 of them. Just 1/4 of the collected readings! A bigger
screen could justify a bigger box to accomidate it.

-In the next revision, more PCB labels would be nice. For instance, 
labeling the positive and negative terminals that the power supply 
will connect to, labels for the different potentiometers like "BIAS"
and "GAIN", and some more general board info on the back potentially.
